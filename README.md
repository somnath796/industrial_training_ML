Have Taken the X_RAY image dataset of COVID patients, Pneumonia patients and Healthy people from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database). Following tasks are performed:


1. Ternary Classification using Custom CNN model and VGG 16(Transfer Learning). Visualizing Feature Map of the model. Comparison of Both Custom and VGG through Accuracy graph.
2. Binary Classification of COVID and normal patients using Custom CNN model and VGG 16(Transfer Learning). Comparison of Both Custom and VGG through ROC Curve(individual and combined).
3. Binary Classification of COVID and Pneumonia patients using Custom CNN model and VGG 16(Transfer Learning). Comparison of Both Custom and VGG through ROC Curve(individual and combined).
